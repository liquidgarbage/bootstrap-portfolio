## Description

This page is a portfolio of my web development work, using bootstrap.  
It is an on-going project. As I learn more the site will have more content.

I built it to provide a portfolio of my work to potential employers.
I also built it for myself. I am proud of the things I have made so far. I am excited to see things become more complex as I learn more.

I solved problems such as:

- figuring out equal cell size grid elements

I learnt:

- how to use bootstrap to design a page
- how to change colour elements of bootstrap such as buttons
- how to customise bootstrap with my own CSS

- [ ] skills section to grid
- [ ] work grid responsive to smaller screens
